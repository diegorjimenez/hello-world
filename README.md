# Hello World!
  I’m an industrial engineer and a graduate student at Rice University pursuing a Master’s degree in Engineering Management. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Miami, and my education has given me a solid foundation in data analytics, operations, and systems optimization.

  I bring both practical experience and academic training to my work, with a strong interest in applying engineering principles to real-world operational challenges — especially in areas like quality assurance, project management, and process improvement. With my background and ongoing graduate training, I’m well-equipped to tackle complex problems in operations and systems engineering with a data-driven mindset.
